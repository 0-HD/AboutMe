I'm a ***computer science student*** at [**IAU**](https://iau.edu.sa) who *likes technology* a little too much. My interests are generally around ***gaming*** and ***innovation***. I like *games* (but don't play much), and I generally love ***new technology***, whether it is *software* or *hardware*.

I've started the ***citric*** project, which was an idea I had for *over 2 years* now. I won't be spoiling anything for now, but you'll love what's hopefully coming in the *future of citric*. This is *just the beginning*, and we're starting with a ***Discord community server***. Join us! The link is simple: **[join.ctrc.cc](https://join.ctrc.cc)**.

You can follow me **[@0ctrc](https://github.com/0ctrc)** in almost every social media platform. YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, you name it.

Make sure to follow **[@ctrcSA](https://twitter.com/ctrcSA)** *everywhere* (and **[@ctrc*K*SA](https://instagram.com/ctrcKSA)** for *Instagram* only)! It's my long-term project and I hope it never disappoints you.
